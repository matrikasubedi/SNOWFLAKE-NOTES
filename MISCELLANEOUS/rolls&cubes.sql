--- by week number units sold(sales)
-- Example 1:  Here is a query with a basic GROUP BY clause over 3 columns:
SELECT WEEK(SALES_DATE) AS WEEK,
       DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE) AS DAY_WEEK,
       SALES_PERSON, SUM(SALES) AS UNITS_SOLD       
  FROM SALES

-- Produce the result based on two different grouping sets of rows from the SALES table.
-- Example 2:  Produce the result based on two different grouping sets of rows from the SALES table.
SELECT WEEK(SALES_DATE) AS WEEK,
         DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE) AS DAY_WEEK,

ORDER BY WEEK, DAY_WEEK, SALES_PERSON;

-- The rows with WEEK 13 are from the first grouping set and the other rows are from the second grouping set.

-- Example 3:  If you use the 3 distinct columns involved in the grouping sets of Example 2 
-- and perform a ROLLUP, you can see grouping sets for (WEEK,DAY_WEEK,SALES_PERSON), (WEEK, DAY_WEEK), (WEEK) and grand total.

  WHERE WEEK(SALES_DATE) = 13
  GROUP BY ROLLUP ( WEEK(SALES_DATE), DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE), SALES_PERSON )
  ORDER BY WEEK, DAY_WEEK, SALES_PERSON;
  
--- Example 4:  If you run the same query as Example 3 only replace ROLLUP with CUBE, 
-- you can see additional grouping sets for (WEEK,SALES_PERSON), (DAY_WEEK,SALES_PERSON), (DAY_WEEK), (SALES_PERSON) in the result.  
  SELECT WEEK(SALES_DATE) AS WEEK,
         DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE) AS DAY_WEEK,

  FROM SALES
  WHERE WEEK(SALES_DATE) = 13
  GROUP BY CUBE ( WEEK(SALES_DATE), DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE), SALES_PERSON )
  ORDER BY WEEK, DAY_WEEK, SALES_PERSON;


-- Example 5:  Obtain a result set which includes a grand-total of selected rows from the SALES table 
-- together with a group of rows aggregated by SALES_PERSON and MONTH.

  SELECT SALES_PERSON,
         MONTH(SALES_DATE) AS MONTH,

                         )
  ORDER BY SALES_PERSON, MONTH;

-- Example 6:  This example shows two simple ROLLUP queries followed by a query which treats the two ROLLUPs 
-- as grouping sets in a single result set and specifies row ordering for each column involved in the grouping sets.
-- Example 6-1:

 SELECT WEEK(SALES_DATE) AS WEEK,
         DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE) AS DAY_WEEK,
         SUM(SALES) AS UNITS_SOLD
  FROM SALES
  GROUP BY ROLLUP ( WEEK(SALES_DATE), DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE) )
  ORDER BY WEEK, DAY_WEEK;

-- Example 6-2:
 SELECT MONTH(SALES_DATE) AS MONTH,
         REGION,
         SUM(SALES) AS UNITS_SOLD
  FROM SALES
  GROUP BY ROLLUP ( MONTH(SALES_DATE), REGION )
  ORDER BY MONTH, REGION;

-- Example 6-3:

SELECT WEEK(SALES_DATE) AS WEEK,
       DAYOFWEEK(SALES_DATE) AS DAY_WEEK,
       MONTH(SALES_DATE) AS MONTH,
       REGION,
